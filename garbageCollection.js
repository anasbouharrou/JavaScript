      So Basicly the Global Object wich every javascript object

      Stored in Protoypely Store RÃ©ference to family Object Variable 

      and family object variable store two reference , to mother Object  
      
      Variable and father Object Variable , and Both Of those Objects 

      store Refenreces to primitive values , and References to each Others .

    ------------Explanation Ended ----------- */

   cause we just delted reference from family  

   we need to delete reference from mother too */ 

   delete family.mother.husban;

   /* Now husband object became inreacheble 

   So the object primitives will be deleted 

   By javaScript By Garbage Collector */
